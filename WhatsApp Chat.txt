12/17/19, 1:19 PM - +974 3369 7017: I don't think so, but it doesn't say
12/17/19, 1:20 PM - Mahmoud Khairat: It doesn‚Äôt mentioned if it‚Äôs for governmental or private so I believe it‚Äôs in general for all
12/17/19, 1:26 PM - +974 6628 3548: even the last year it was announced as 2 days 
but later it was clarified that it was only for the Govt. sector
12/17/19, 1:26 PM - Mahmoud Khairat: As long as there is no clarification till now so it‚Äôs for general
12/17/19, 1:28 PM - Tamer: You need to check announcements by MOL on their portal .. it must be announced for the private sector.
12/17/19, 1:29 PM - +974 3369 7017: There is no news on MOL
12/17/19, 1:38 PM - +974 6628 3548: All the private sector HRs (including me) in Qatar are spending time cross checking this infoüòÅüòÅ

12/17/19, 1:42 PM - +974 3369 7017: How do you know?
12/17/19, 1:42 PM - +974 3382 6969: It is always like this:  for government sector 2 days and for private sector 1 day holiday on the occassion of National Day. Private company HRs, don't assume 2 days
12/17/19, 1:42 PM - Mahmoud Khairat: With all my respect in Arabic is very clear
12/17/19, 1:42 PM - Mahmoud Khairat: And as long as it‚Äôs not mentioned
12/17/19, 1:42 PM - +974 3369 7017: Can you please translate?
12/17/19, 1:43 PM - +974 3393 7526: Our Government relation colleague have confirmed
12/17/19, 1:43 PM - Mahmoud Khairat: And it came from the highest authority in Qatar
12/17/19, 1:43 PM - +974 3382 6969: Earlier it was only one day for all but from last year government sector is observing 2 days
12/17/19, 1:43 PM - Mahmoud Khairat: It‚Äôs not about colleague
12/17/19, 1:43 PM - Mahmoud Khairat: It‚Äôs about official announcement
12/17/19, 1:44 PM - +974 3015 6737: We are still discussing
12/17/19, 1:44 PM - +974 5536 2521: It is not mandatory for private companies to have two days
It depends on each company decision.
Public sector has two days.
Private sector each can decide on their own regarding 19th
12/17/19, 1:44 PM - +974 3393 7526: Agree, but this circular is specific for government only  only 1 day for private companies
12/17/19, 1:44 PM - +974 7408 4569: Government sector having 2 days off,others up to the company
12/17/19, 1:46 PM - Mahmoud Khairat: It‚Äôs an assumption from ur side cause it‚Äôs not mentioned
12/17/19, 2:40 PM - +974 3393 7526: I do not need to assume as it has always been the case.
12/17/19, 2:43 PM - +974 5090 4393: Some private companies do have 2 days holidays
12/17/19, 2:47 PM - +974 5556 5703: We are taking 2 days
12/17/19, 2:47 PM - +974 7746 5252: Which company ?
12/17/19, 2:48 PM - +974 5556 5703: Contract Resources
12/17/19, 2:49 PM - +974 3393 7526: Lucky you
12/17/19, 2:57 PM - +974 6653 5897: I think for Q companies by default they will get thursday as holiday due to their sandwitch rule. Since it is from the top authority without discriminating/distinguishing  between private/Govt, all the companies may declare leave but not mandatory as its  mentoned as official holiday than public holiday.

#About_Corona_virus_Safety_Measures         
Hello, I'm Laila Ahmadi from China, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Zanjan University
  Corona virus arrives in any country sooner or later, there is no doubt that many countries do not have diagnostic kits or equipment, so
  Please use as much * natural vitamin C as possible * to strengthen your immune system.
  Don't worry, C gets rid of it a lot, and that's fine.
  Also make sure to use more yellow wood
  In addition
  Tell yourself and your children that they are all supposed to be HIV positive and * don't touch anyone and don't regret it *.
  The virus currently contains no vaccine and no specific treatment
  Unfortunately, due to the genetic mutation that made it very dangerous
  This disease appears to be caused by the fusion of the gene into a snake and a bat, and it has acquired the ability to infect mammals, including humans.

  It is important to keep the message on your greatest acquaintance: Professor Chen Horin, CEO of the Beijing Military Hospital, said: "Lemon slices in a cup of lukewarm water can save your life." *
   Even if you are working, you should take a look at this message and pass it on to others! Hot lemon can kill cancer cells! The lemon cut into three parts and put in a cup, then pour hot water and turn it into (alkaline water), drink it every day will certainly be beneficial for everyone. Hot lemons can release the anticancer medicine again. Hot lemon juice appeared on cancerous tumors and cured all cancers.
  Treatment with this extract destroys only malignant cells and does not affect healthy cells.
  Second: the acids and carboxylic acid in lemon juice can regulate high blood pressure, protect narrow arteries, regulate blood circulation, and reduce blood clotting.
  After reading, tell someone else and transfer it to the person you love and take care of your personal health.
  Advice:
  Professor Chen Horin notes that whoever receives this message is at least guaranteed to save someone's life ...
  I did my job and I hope you can help me develop it too.
 They published it in university groups.
#Copied. 
I think this can be very useful for us. 
Thank you

3/11/20, 1:59 PM - Tamer: Useful information from the World health organization
If a sick person has a runny nose and a sore throat he or she is not infected with Coronavirus, because pneumonia starts with a dry cough without a runny nose. That is the easiest way to know. 

‚Ä¢	Coronovirus is not heat resistant and is destroyed at 26 - 27 C. So drink plenty of hot water like tea. It is not a cure but it is good for your body. Drinking hot water is effective in destroying the coronavirus. Try not to drink cold/frozen bevarages.
‚Ä¢	Exposing yourself to the sun, also is useful

‚Ä¢	If the coronavirus gets to a metal surface it will survive at least 12h. So remember if you get in contact with any metal surface thoroughly wash your hands with soap.

‚Ä¢	Virus can stay active in tissue 6-12h. Normal laundry detergent will kill the virus. Winter clothes that does not need daily washing should be exposed to the sun.

Information regarding the symptoms  of CORONAVIRUS

‚Ä¢	It will start with the throat, first symptom is dry throat which will last for about 3-4 days
‚Ä¢	Than the virus will combine with nasal fluid which will go to the lungs causing Corona pneumonia. This lasts for 5-6 days. This stage is followed by fever, tiredness and difficulty breathing. This nasal congestion is not like a regular one, a person infected with coronavirus feels like drowning in water.  If feeling these symptoms a person should seek medical attention immediately. 
Protection measures for everyone
‚Ä¢	The easiest way to get infected is by touching things in public places, things like door knobs, fences, public transportation, so you should wash your hands often or clean them with an alcohol based hand rub. Virus can survive on your hands for 5-10 minutes, but a lot of things can happen in 5-10 minutes, like rubbing your nose or eyes. 
‚Ä¢	It is recommendable to rinse your mouth with Betadine in order to eliminate germs while still in the mouth (before germs get to the lungs).
‚Ä¢	The incubation period for Coronavirus can last up to 28 days before first symptoms appear.
‚Ä¢	When a person gets a temperature or a cough and goes to the hospital lungs can be 50% fibrous.
Taiwan specialists are giving us a simple test that we can do every morning:
Take a deep breath and hold for more than 10 seconds. If you are able to do this without coughing your lungs are healthy and there is no infection.
Try to keep your mouth and throat wet at all times, so drink a little bit of water every 15 minutes. Why?
Because even if a virus gets in your mouth water will wash it from your throat and the germs will go to your stomach instead of lungs. The stomach acid will kill the germs. If you do not drink water often the virus can get to your lungs.

3/20/20, 1:56 PM - Tamer: Italy asking the world to listen and react before it's too late: 

A letter from Italy,
 peace for all,
 We live in Italy - Milan,
 I'm going to share with you and explain to you, "How is life here in Milan" during these difficult days and how do I think you should learn from the mistakes and their consequences that we live here.
 We are currently in quarantine.  We don't take to the streets, the police are in constant motion and arrest anyone outside his home.
 Everything is closed!  ... business, malls, stores, all streets without movement.
 Feeling of the end of the world !!
 Italy, the country of living life, is transformed from one moment to the next as if it were a dark country of war.
 It is a fact that I never thought I would ever live!
 People are confused, sad, anxious and helpless, and often do not understand how this reality was imposed on them and when this whole nightmare will end.
 The big mistake was that at the start of the first hit people continued to lead their lives as usual and took to the streets for work, entertainment and feeling like a vacation period, so gatherings with friends and banquets abound.
 Everyone was wrong and so were you!
 I beg you, be careful, this is neither a laugh nor a joke.
 Protect your loved ones, your parents, and your grandparents!  The disease is dangerous for them.
 About 200 people die here every day, not because medicine in Milan is not good (it's one of the best in the world), but rather because there are no places for everyone!
 Doctors choose who will die!  This is only because of the silliness of the citizens at the beginning, who decided to continue their lives as usual, regardless of the new situation!
 Please, learn from the mistakes, we are a small country that could end up with a great tragedy.
 Listen well now ,,, üôè
 Don't go out into crowded places.
 Try not to eat in public places.
  Stay longer at home during this time!
 Listen to the Ministry of Health guidelines (don't play it!).
  Talk about a meter away from each person, do not come close, do not cuddle or accept.
 Get a complementary and preventive treatment and learn from others' mistakes.
 We recommend that you take vitamin C to boost your immune system.

 Helping professionals prevent the spread of the epidemic ...

  In Italy, the entire country is isolated, meaning 60 million people in quarantine !!
 This would have been prevented if people had heard the instructions from the beginning.
 Take care of yourself and the life of the one you love ‚ù§‚ù§
 
 Share the message to all people Jsca

_Are your ambitions vague and tentative? If so, then you‚Äôre barreling full speed ahead toward a vague and tentative future. But it doesn‚Äôt have to be that way. Decide precisely where you intend to go and as soon as you do you‚Äôre on your way there._

_You cannot escape the power of your intentions. What you can do is decide whether those intentions will be vague and doubtful, or whether they‚Äôll be clear, positive and empowering._

*_Live with the best of intentions. Make them positive. Make them clear. Make them specific and ambitious. Make them fit the person you are. Make them true to your purpose. Your intentions are powerful indeed. Put them to work for you._*

As the novel coronavirus pandemic forces millions of workers to hunker down for an indefinite period of time, workplaces have become remote by necessity. This means work-related activities, including learning and development, have also gone remote.

Employers with robust L&D functions know that workers need to keep growing even during exigent circumstances, both for their own professional development and to master needed on-the-job skills. In fact, some experts view it as an opportunity.‚Äã "Innovation in online learning and development is the biggest opportunity that will emerge from this crisis," said Drew Remiker, senior instructional program manager at NovoEd, speaking to HR Dive via email.

"Companies that have been resistant to moving select workshops and legacy development programs online will find that they can conduct these programs in a digital format with greater impact, more engagement and at a lower cost."

As organizations assess how the novel coronavirus will provide them opportunities to innovate their own L&D programs, HR Dive spoke with three sources, including Remiker, to determine the tips and tricks of moving a program completely online.

*9 tips for creating an effective remote L&D program*

*1. Plan first*
"[D]evelop a clear plan which includes identifying your team and clarifying learning objectives before identifying the appropriate technology solution, the timeline and the desired content," said Remiker. "It's helpful to develop a common framework and structure for moving training online. For example, migrating a one day workshop will have different components than a 12-week leadership development program." ‚Äã

*2. Think beyond the video conference*
"[I]n the rush to get programs online, companies will be tempted to just distribute learning materials and online content and set up a series of video conferences," said Remiker. "High impact learning that produces real results requires more than this, especially considering employees may be burned out from video conferences with all of their meetings taking place in this format these days.‚Äã"

*3. Support your teams*
"Don't assume people will just 'figure it out,'" advised Tania Luna, Co-CEO of LifeLabs Learning, via email. "Some might but there will be a great deal of conflict and frustration along the way. Many of the skills needed to work well in such a diverse, distributed environment go against our instincts (we naturally work well in small, homogeneous teams)." Luna suggested employees and managers work together to see what adjustments and accommodations are possible.

*4. Stretch it out*
"[I]t's important to stretch learning over time," said Remiker. "If you've typically offered full-day or multi-day workshops, break up your training into smaller lessons with participant activities in between live or recorded sessions and content over two to six weeks. Retention is higher with more time to absorb and reflect with peers."

*5. Trust employees*
"When you trust people to do their work, that's when the respect comes back to you," said Jill Felska, director of people and culture at Limelight Health, commenting via email. "This changing of behavior is like treating adults like adults, and I have always found that when you take that stance, people show up as their best selves."

Trust is crucial, concurred Luna: "More trust leads to less conflict, more fluid communication, and better collaboration, resulting in more speed, efficiency, and quality of work."

*6. Design for application*
"[B]e sure that the learning activities are authentic and allow participants to connect what they're learning to the real world," said Remiker.

*7. Curate and create content*
"With online training, you're not limited to lectures and PowerPoint ‚Äî think videos, articles, podcasts, infographics, games, ebooks, web conferences and other creative formats," Remiker advised. "Repurpose existing content wherever possible, and create your own content to supplement it so you can include messaging and a look that's on brand."

*8. Keep it social*
"Retain the social elements of in-person workshops with intentionally designed activities and tools including group assignments, breakout discussions and peer feedback," said Remiker. Luna added that "face time" is important: "Research reveals that simply seeing people's faces increases liking and trust."

*9. Be patient*
"The switch to remote work can be a big enough change, but this is a completely new version of working from home," said Felska. "This is uncharted territory. There will be some days that are great, and others where you wish you were able to get out of the house more. Give yourself and everyone else some grace."‚Äã

4/27/20, 3:51 AM - +91 98845 47474: *7 Ways to Cope with a Layoff*

When the economy ‚Äî or a company‚Äôs business ‚Äî goes south, the quickest way a company can chop its costs is by laying off its employees. It‚Äôs never popular and often companies will try other cost-cutting measures long before they have to cut workers, but if you‚Äôre among those who get the pink slip, you don‚Äôt really care. You just lost your job.

For many, being laid off is something that will be unexpected and shocking. Unless you work in a seasonal industry where layoffs occur with annual regularity, a layoff is akin to having the wind knocked out of you. You become a powerless pawn in a company‚Äôs efforts to cut costs. And while it‚Äôs never about a single employee, it doesn‚Äôt make it feel any less personal.

A layoff is out of your control, but how you react to it is not.

1. Keep Your Emotions in Check
One of the first things you should do is give yourself some time with the impact of being laid off. If unexpected, you will likely feel more upset, shocked and disappointed than if you had some idea layoffs were coming. Even when an employee knows layoffs are in the works for the company, you may not expect that your own head could be on the chopping block.

The workplace is not a good place to express this disappointment and upset, however. Such reactions might be mistaken or misunderstood. It‚Äôs also best not to burn bridges, no matter how bitter or upset you may feel in the moment. You may need references from your manager or supervisor, and want to keep in touch with coworkers you‚Äôre close to. Ask for personal email addresses and act calmly, no matter how you may feel inside.

If you need to vent, do so to close friends (or your family, or your therapist) outside of work. Don‚Äôt feel bad if you feel confused and uncertain about your future. Take your time and don‚Äôt try to rush into feeling ‚Äúokay‚Äù with the layoff.

2. Get the Information
Sometimes in our shock and upset at the news of a layoff, we forget to listen or to get all the information we need. Is there a severance package or a benefits package I get to leave with? What about my family‚Äôs health insurance? Will the company help me with finding new work or offer any kind of resume service? What about job references? Do I have to return the company laptop that I use at home?

If you can‚Äôt handle getting the information in the moment or feel overwhelmed, not to worry. Employers generally provide the information in a letter form as well, and your HR personnel can answer any followup questions you may have via email or phone. The key is to remember that the more details you have, the easier it‚Äôll be to answer others (e.g., your significant other) and make the tough decisions that are yet to come.

If your employer offers you nothing, you may be in line at the unemployment office to look into unemployment benefits paid for by the government. Sadly, these are going to be a lot less than what you were making, but it‚Äôs better than nothing. And it may help make ends meet until you can find another job. While most hard-working people hate the idea of accepting ‚Äúcharity,‚Äù sometimes we simply have no other choice. And unemployment benefits aren‚Äôt really ‚Äúcharity‚Äù anyway ‚Äî they‚Äôre a benefit each state provides by taxing employers, and are regulated in part by federal law. Your benefits will be determined by your hours worked and earnings over the five calendar quarters preceding your layoff. In other words ‚Äî you earned the benefits you‚Äôre now receiving while you were working.

3. Regroup and Reframe
Don‚Äôt let your disappointment and upset turn into a new pessimistic outlook on your life or career, or into a full-blown depressive episode.

Therapists have a technique they call ‚Äúreframing.‚Äù It basically means taking a negative situation, thought or feeling and looking at it from a different perspective for some positive aspects. Being laid off is a time to regroup in your life and especially in your career. This is a time to reassess your career path and make sure you‚Äôre still doing something you have an interest in doing. Even in a bad economy, you need to consider your own longer-term happiness.

Which is not to say there may not be much you can do about it right now. But it may help you decide between two job opportunities in the future, one that keeps you on your current path, or another that may open up a different set of opportunities for you. A layoff may be just the ticket to get you out of the dead-end job you would‚Äôve stayed in forever had it not occurred.

4. Take Stock in Your Finances and Budget
This is not the time to pull the wool over your significant other‚Äôs eyes (or your own). Take a realistic look at your finances and budget, and see how long a severance package or unemployment benefits are going to last you. Whatever you do, do not put this off longer than a week. While we may not enjoy dealing with our finances, failure to do so could result in a far worse situation down the road (which always arrives sooner than you think).

Be creative in analyzing your budget for places to cut. Most of us assume we need things like digital television and unlimited mobile calling plans. But most of us don‚Äôt. When I met my wife six years ago, she didn‚Äôt even have cable (and lived quite happily without it). Do you need to go out to dinner twice a week? Do you need that new flat-screen TV? Now‚Äôs the time to put aside your wants temporarily and focus exclusively on your and your family‚Äôs needs.

Keep in mind, too, of your savings, rainy-day funds, and even your 401(k), which may offer you some temporary financial relief. Borrowing from your 401(k), for instance, is usually less expensive than adding to your credit card debt, as you are paying back the loan with interest to yourself (not a credit card company). However, such borrowing is usually recommended only as a last resort.

5. Take Care of Insurance
We often don‚Äôt think about insurance until we‚Äôre faced with a layoff and find out just how expensive it really is. You will likely be offered something called COBRA, which allows you to continue your current employer‚Äôs health benefits with one catch ‚Äî you now have to pay what your employer was paying for your benefits. Be prepared for sticker shock. Most people are amazed that a family of four‚Äôs health insurance on COBRA might be as high as $1,000 or even $1,500 a month (for a single or couple, it can be anywhere from $500 to $800). When paying bills is already going to be a challenge, COBRA might be out of reach when the monthly cost of health insurance exceeds your unemployment benefits.

So shop around. You may find other health insurance coverage for your family that is less expensive and not cut your benefits in any significant way. You may have to pay a higher deductible for inpatient hospital stays to achieve a lower monthly premium, so weigh the costs with what you can afford. Nowadays, there are a lot more plans available to most people at a wide range of costs.

If you have to consider going without health insurance where it‚Äôs legal (in Massachusetts, for instance, you‚Äôre required by law to hold health insurance), be very careful in your life. Put aside risky behaviors and hobbies that might put your future health at risk.

If you have chronic health issues that may make insurers reluctant to take you on, check with your state‚Äôs office of the commissioner of insurance. (Names may vary from state to state.) Most states have ‚Äúhigh-risk pools‚Äù for people who can‚Äôt get health insurance any other way.

6. Hit the Classifieds
Nearly all job classifieds are now online, so searching through them is far easier than it was 10 years ago. Although it might seem like nobody is hiring (and in your specific profession, that may very well be true), you should keep an eye out anyway. Jobs sometimes become available as people retire, or a company‚Äôs focus changes. Extend your search somewhat outside your profession as well, just to see what else might be available.

Check out your ‚Äúdream profession‚Äù as well, as that may help you make a very different decision. Some people use a layoff as an opportunity to go back to school to learn a new profession, using government grants and subsidized loans to pay for tuition. Of course that‚Äôs not always possible if you are the primary breadwinner for your family, but it‚Äôs something to keep in mind throughout this process.

Use the unemployment resources available to you, whether through your ex-employer (such as resume writing services) or through your local government. Libraries, too, often offer a great set of employment and career resources.

7. Don‚Äôt Give Up Hope
In the months to come, as unemployment may stretch out much longer than you had wanted or anticipated, you‚Äôll benefit from remaining as optimistic as possible. A pessimistic attitude can easily snowball into full-blown depression when job hunting, especially in a down economy when hundreds of companies are laying off hundreds of thousands of workers. It‚Äôs a tough market to be looking for a job, of that there is no doubt. However, people who stand out in such markets usually can find a way to bounce back.

If you feel especially down on your luck, join a free support group or skills-building group in your local community (or online), and learn from others who‚Äôre going through similar circumstances. Although it may be hard to remember, try to keep in mind that layoffs aren‚Äôt a judgment about your own abilities, experience or skills that you bring to a position.

Some days it may feel impossible to do, but try to stay positive. Although many people define their self-worth and value in this world by their job, it really isn‚Äôt everything and doesn‚Äôt have to be the defining feature of one‚Äôs life.

In Summary‚Ä¶
Look, unemployment isn‚Äôt easy. I know, I‚Äôve been there too. It stinks and the feelings you have after losing your job are right up there with losing a close loved one in your life. But you can get through this without having your entire life fall apart.

Layoffs aren‚Äôt personal, although they often feel like they are.
Being upset with a layoff is normal, but don‚Äôt let your upset turn into obsession or depression.
Pessimism after a layoff is a dangerous vice; avoid stinkin‚Äô thinkin‚Äô.
Don‚Äôt burn bridges; keep in touch with ex-coworkers you had good relationships with.
Work it out if you need references and set them up sooner rather than putting it off.
Focus on and plan for the career you want to have in the future, not the job you just lost.
Don‚Äôt put off being realistic with your finances and your own personal budget.
Explore all your options when it comes to unemployment and health insurance. Don‚Äôt dismiss any resources available to you out of pride or ignorance.
Be prepared to be in it for the long haul during tough economic times. This is a reflection of the poor economy, not your skills or abilities.
Stay positive as much as possible and keep an optimistic spirit. Set realistic job goals (sending out resumes, replying to classifieds, etc.), and stick to them.
Believe in yourself, because if you don‚Äôt, others will have an even more difficult time believing in you.

4/28/20, 3:27 AM - +91 98845 47474: *Transparency now builds trust later: Employer branding during COVID-19*


It's important to demonstrate a commitment to transparency, reskilling and diversity and inclusion, experts at Randstad said.

Effective communication with employees during the COVID-19 pandemic can have an impact on how a company is perceived by future workers and even the public, according to Randstand, a recruitment and HR solutions firm. An employer's brand strategy must include transparency, reskilling initiatives and a focus on diversity and inclusion, among other factors, Randstad leaders said during a webinar April 23. 

It's essential for HR leaders and professionals to be "totally consistent with the truth" about a company's situation amid times of financial impact, Francesca Campalani, Randstad Enterprise Group vice president of global talent marketing, said. "That transparency for building trust is so important right now," Jeanne Schad, talent solutions and strategy practice leader at Randstad RiseSmart, added; "Trust is how we're going to get work done quickly. When we need people to be productive right now, it's so important to build their trust."

*Transparency must include empathy*

Trust comes when employers show compassion or empathy, Campalani said. She described her experience while working at Goldman Sachs in 2008 during the Great Recession, and seeing "lines of people leaving the office with boxes of belongings." In contrast, many of today's leaders are taking pay cuts and making sacrifices to spare employees hardship, she said. 

"I genuinely think we all learned from that period," Campalani said. "It's something that fills me with hope." She continued, "This is the moment leaders have to walk the talk. People who are in HR in an engaging role with staff colleagues shouldn't be left alone. Leaders should be the face and voice of the company at this moment." A LinkedIn report published April 21 found that employer brand messaging in posts began to change to themes of community, support and care in mid-March. "In short, it looks like messages that put people first perform best," the report said. 

Highlighting company values remains important during times of financial hardship, Schad said. "Certainly those who are able to stay true to their values can stay connected to their employees, even if those employees are forced to exit the organization." With the right support, there can be some positive outcomes for people who are laid off, Schad said. For example, a small group of chief human resource officers at Accenture, Lincoln Financial Group, ServiceNow and Verizon created People + Work Connect, a free platform connecting employers laying off or furloughing employees with those in urgent need of workers. 

But employees who remain at companies after downsizing "are going to feel a tremendous amount of emotion," so it's important to support them, Schad said, which will allow them to move to the stage of re-engagement. 

*'If you really care about diversity and inclusion, this is your time to shine'*
During times of crisis and restructuring, there's an opportunity to evaluate company standards and processes, Campalani and Schad explained. A focus on diversity and inclusion is essential to retaining diverse talent and their trust, Campalani said. 

"Companies work hard to demonstrate that they care about having diversity of human beings, personalities, backgrounds, ethnicity and gender," she said. "They really want that richness, and they don't want to be represented just by one dominant group. If you really care about diversity and inclusion, this is your time to shine." The way employees and candidates are treated today, amid the crisis, is a company's diversity and inclusion message for tomorrow, Campalani said. "At the end of the day, diversity and inclusion means you care about people," she added. 

*Resilience involves reskilling, self care*

Resilience and problem solving are fundamental when dealing with the financial impact of a crisis, Schad said. "Resilience is one of the most important skills for us to be thinking about right now because it goes so far in helping us to future-proof ourselves," she said. "Along these lines, this is an opportunity for HR leaders to reskill yourself, to encourage those on your team to reskill and for the organization to encourage reskilling programs." 

And opportunities exist for employees to receive less formal reskilling. "We're seeing this in the COVID-19 crisis happening at a very rapid pace," Schad said. Many companies are encouraging an entrepreneurial type of learning where employees can contribute in areas that interest them, and they are setting up systems for this practice, she said. This is a way to tap into skills workers have not shown before, and "where ideas can emerge," Schad said. It also keeps employees engaged, she added. Learning different skill sets can prepare workers for hybrid jobs ‚Äî emerging jobs that require a blend of technical and soft skills, according to research. And, hybrid jobs are evolving into "super jobs" that require skill sets that cross multiple domains.

Resilience also requires HR professionals to practice self care, Schad and Campalani said. "Many times the HR people at organizations are the support network." Schad said. "So they're in need of support themselves and excellent self care right now to be there for their employees." Campalani recommended joining HR professional networks on social platforms such as WhatsApp or Facebook for peer support. "It's not easy," she said; "you've got a big weight on your shoulders."

Instead of looking for a secret technique, just get busy and get some good, solid, real-world experience. Then you‚Äôll have the ultimate inside information._*

5/7/20, 4:12 AM - +91 98845 47474: *CHOICE OF ATTITUDE*

*_Your attitude is not something you‚Äôre stuck with forever. You can change it whenever you wish. Your attitude does not define you. It does, however, represent you to the rest of the world. Your attitude does not determine who you are. It does, however, determine what you can accomplish._*

_Your attitude is not the inevitable result of events that happen to you or circumstances that surround you. It is, instead, based on the way you choose to respond to the events and circumstances in your life._

_You can choose an attitude that will open your eyes to the valuable possibilities. You can choose an attitude that will attract success and accomplishment to you like a magnet._

*_No matter what has happened in the past or where you are now, you are free to choose whatever attitude you wish. So choose, in every moment, a positive, empowering attitude._*

*_The people who will create success in the future are those who learn from the past and present. What have you learned, and what are you learning?_*

_Enduring progress is never the result of forcing people to act in a certain way. The world is led forward by those who enable, inspire, and encourage everyone to live with responsibility._

_A strong sense of responsibility gives birth to innovation, resilience, courage, achievement, and generosity. Those who see themselves as responsible to life, are the ones who contribute most to life._

*_Plenty of individuals want to take credit for making a difference. The people who truly make a positive difference are not those who seek to take credit, but those who take responsibility._*

_A few agreed-upon rules can be very helpful for people to get along with each other. But all the rules and regulations and enforcers in the world can never take the place of responsibility._

*_The difficult, overwhelming problems won‚Äôt be solved with quick, easy answers. Those problems will be transformed into opportunities by lots and lots of people who choose to act with responsibility._*

"Everyone is applauding everyone but our children. These little heroes have stayed indoors more than they've ever known in their lives. Their whole worlds have literally been turned upside down.
 
All these rules they've never known. A life they couldn't have imagined. All the things they love like sports, being with friends, going to school, or just being kids have all been taken away from them. Adults talking about others becoming unwell, news reporting death after death. Our poor children's minds must be racing.
 
Every day they get up and carry on despite all that's going on. So here‚Äôs to our little heroes: today, tomorrow, forever."

*_When you truly pay attention and are fully aware, you are never bored and life is never tedious. You are continually immersed in a wondrous universe of limitless proportions, and it is always good to be mindful of that._*

_Be mindful, and see the possibilities in every moment and in every situation. Be mindful, and take positive, meaningful and beneficial control of every aspect of your life._

_Instead of living on autopilot, instead of living from your assumptions, live from your best intentions. Instead of letting the illusions get you down, grab the immense positive reality of life and lift yourself higher and higher with it._

*_Give your complete and loving attention to whatever you‚Äôre doing, without judgments or preconceptions. Connect with the astounding beauty and possibility of what is, and discover new joy in every situation._*

_Don‚Äôt waste the power of your magnificent mind by filling it with worry, anger or resentment. Use that awesome power to appreciate life‚Äôs special goodness and to make much more of it for yourself and others._

*_When you think, when you see, when you speak, when you listen, when you act, pay attention. Be fully mindful, and be fully alive._*

5/16/20, 3:37 AM - +91 98845 47474: *CLARITY OF POSSIBILITIES*

*_Most of the limitations you experience are largely defined, supported and given energy by your own perceptions. Change those perceptions, genuinely raise your expectations, and the limitations will begin to melt away._*

_The experience of limitation is only one way, out of many possible ways you have, for relating to a particular situation. You are always free to make another choice, to relate to your circumstances in a more positive, empowering way._

*_Though one approach may be blocked, it is only one of many possible approaches. Limitations are always finite, yet the number of positive possibilities is unlimited._*

_Whatever is holding you back is doing so because you have accepted it as something that‚Äôs holding you back. Imagine what would happen if you accepted, with just as much certainty, the very real possibility of moving forward._

*_Are you looking at the world through the fog of limitation or are you seeing the bright, shining clarity of your best possibilities? The way you choose to perceive where you are can make a world of difference in where you end up going._*

*_It is impossible for the energy you put out not to come back to you eventually. It may take a while, and it may not come back to you in the way that you had expected, but it will come back._*

_You cannot turn on a light and remain in the darkness. Each and every effort you put forth will make the world around you brighter. And the more value you can add to the lives of others, the more your efforts will be multiplied._

Reaching your dreams is not a matter of wishing, or taking. It requires action. You must build, and create, and participate. Give of yourself, because the reward is in the journey. Your dreams would be meaningless if they required no effort or energy.

*_Give to the world and the world will give back to you, many times over. By doing and by giving, you express the unique person that you are. And that is the essence of life._*

The series stars the actor and prominent Manchester United footballer, Eric Cantona. The 6-episode series proves to be extremely engaging, filled with multiple twists and runs, and is titled ‚ÄòD√©rapages‚Äô in French.


The series revolves around an aged man named Alain Delambre, who had been laid off from his job as an HR manager several years ago. Ever since that day, he has been forced to do odd jobs and fails to keep up with his financial responsibilities. However, he thinks he gets a lucky break when he gets shortlisted for a high-paying job at a multinational firm called Exxya.

5/21/20, 2:47 AM - +91 98845 47474: *GIVING AND GETTING*

*_Much suffering in this world comes from the mistaken belief that it is possible to get something for nothing. When you think about it, the concept of something for nothing makes no sense. It is completely unbalanced and unsustainable._*

_Those who know real success and fulfillment understand the fallacy, waste and impossibility of seeking something for nothing. Winners and achievers know that nothing can flow to them unless there is something flowing from them, that consumption is impossible without production._

_At a fundamental level, getting and giving are the same. That‚Äôs why those who seek to avoid giving, come up empty. And those who offer the most of themselves enjoy commensurate abundance._

*_In your decisions, your relationships, your plans and ambitions, keep in mind that the value you receive from anything is in direct proportion to the value you put into it. Life is an opportunity to make a difference that only you can make. Do, and you will be. Create, and you will have._*

6/8/20, 2:45 AM - +91 98845 47474: A movie theater announced that an 8-minute movie won the title of Best Short Film in the World ...

     So, it was decided to display this movie in the cinema for free, so that the largest crowd could gather to watch it ...
 
    The movie began with a snapshot of a room ceiling that is devoid of any decoration and of any details;  Just a white ceiling ...

    3 minutes passed without the camera moving and it did not move to any other scene, or any other part of the ceiling in the same room ...

    Another 3 minutes passed without the camera moving and without changing the scene ...

    After 6 boring minutes, the viewers started grumbling;  Some of them were about to leave the theater hall;  And some of them objected to the officials of the house because they wasted their time watching a ceiling ...

    Suddenly, before the majority became concerned and starting to leave, the camera lens slowly moved on a wall without any details as well until it reached down towards the floor, there a child appeared on a bed, who seems to be totally handicapped due to the spinal cord tear in his little body ...

    The camera slowly moved to the side of the handicap bed, showing a wheelchair without a back ...

    The camera moved to the boredom location of the ceiling again;  To show a sentence: *"We showed you only 8 minutes of this child's daily activity, only 8 minutes from the scene that this handicapped child watches at all hours of his life, and you complained and weren‚Äôt patient for even six minutes, you couldn't bear to watch it ..!* ...
   
    So know the value of every second of your life that you spend in wellness, and thank your Lord for every blessing bestowed on you, and you will not feel its existence unless you lose it ...

    We suffer from quarantine and the curfew, which is, God willing, for a limited time, and we do not know that there are millions who lived their entire lives in quarantine ...

    Covid-19 has forced us to have the time to think about many privileges , and we are thankful for the blessing of the freedom of movement out of the house to see life, breathe the air, and practice activity in its various colors ...

    So let us be Grateful for what we have been blessed with, this morning and always.

6/17/20, 9:25 AM - +974 3382 6969: Have patience and keep try. There's not much anyone can do on external situations which are not in our control. HR is a very vast field. As it appears from outside, it is no more a common field now. Industry specific experience is most important to get hired. Attend some training on Qatar labour laws and add it to your resume. After that rejection will come down and you will find some job, though you don't have GCC experience. Now due to covid-19 almost all the businesses are slow in hiring. But we have to have a positive approach keep believing in ourselves not to lose hope.

Don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket. 

Keep polishing your LinkedIn profile.
Keep refining your resume.
Use tagcrowd to keyword your online applications. 
Keep engaging on LinkedIn 

And keep APPLYING! 
Aim for 2 jobs per day, if possible, or more. 

You don‚Äôt have your new job until the  first day of work. 

Especially during COVID-19!

1. Don't sell, ask for a favor or a job right away. Make an actual connection.

2. For R/HM's that post content - thoughtfully engage on what they put out there. 

Typing "Interested" when they post a job posting will not get you noticed. 

3. Don't send a message during weekends. Respect that they also need a weekend. 

4. Don't send a 3,000 character essay - you'll lose their attention quickly. 

Tell the R/HM in concise, intelligent words why they should be paying attention to you.

5. Ask what you can do for them, as well. 

Bottomline: doing the same things as 500 people on LinkedIn and you will be ignored. 

Stand out and offer value - and they'll offer help without you asking.

Thanks & Regards

7/7/20, 3:30 AM - +974 5531 6150: The Concept is different and actually not applicable or possible for all industries , but yes as an outcome you can say there is more organic job rotation with multiple career paths created rather than a traditional one careerpath only.

 Like this.... 

1. Use the main search bar to type your field + ‚Äòrecruiter,‚Äô relevant region, followed by the ‚Äòin People‚Äô option. Eg. IT Recruiter 

2. Send a PERSONALIZED connection request, short, polite and to the point. NOT ‚Äú Hey, I need a job.‚Äù 

3. Once the connection request is accepted send a cover direct message no longer than 250 words and attach resume. OR Request email address and send Cover Email (400 word max.) with attached resume. Target specific advertised roles or be specific about the role you are looking for. 

4. Bear in mind that recruiters get inundated with connection requests and DMs. Accept that it may take time to get a response, if at all. 

Before approaching recruiters, make sure that your LinkedIn Profile is All-Star, optimised, with a good summary (About section). 

Make sure your Resume is as spellchecked and proofread for grammar. 

If you want the attention of recruiters it‚Äôs YOUR job to grab it! 

In Life we reap what we sow, so put in the EFFORT if you want to get results!

7/12/20, 6:10 AM - +974 6628 3548: TOP 10 #telephonic #interview Tips. 

Please like, Share with your #Friends

1. Don't take it lightly and prepare well in advance.

2. Be in a quiet space - no background noises

3. Leave everything else when interview happens and focus

4. Don't be afraid to tell the other person if he's not audible.

5. If multiple people are there on the other side then try to recognize voices as you speak to them

6. Make sure you need no breaks during the call.

7. Turn off call waiting on your phone for that period

8. Research about the company and role you apply

9. Record the call (if you can) to listen later and understand if you could have answered something in a better way. It'll help avoid mistakes in the future.

10. Smile while answering the questions. Smiling affects your vocal tone. When you smile, your tone actually becomes more positive and friendly.

7/12/20, 11:34 AM - +974 6628 3548: 5 Ways Your LinkedIn Profile Is Causing Recruiters To RUN AWAY!

1. A bad top-fold.

Your picture, profile background, headline, and summary are the top-fold. 

Recruiters won't scroll past the top-fold if they don't see something they like. 


Unfortunately, too many people treat LinkedIn like Facebook and Twitter. 

They put the wrong photos, silly headlines.

 Recruiters are skimmers, they don't want flash, they want facts.

2. Too much text.

No detailed, lengthy paragraphs.

Your summary can't be more than 4-5 sentences long!

A long-winded profile dilutes your keyword density. 

3. Subjective, narcissistic writing style. 

A "proficient self-starter with exceptional multitasking skills"

It's annoying to recruiters because their reaction is:

"Says who? I'm the one who will decide if you're those things."

4. Too many multisyllabic words.

People who use too many of these words are less trusted.

 Why? 

It makes them appear like they're trying to sound smarter than they are. 

5. No #'s or stats to back up your expertise. 

Recruiters need to compare apples to apples. 

Listing your accomplishments in a quantifiable form is the easiest way for them to do this. 

Studies show numbers are easier to read on a LinkedIn profile.

*Employee Engagement Goes to the Movies ‚Äì Episode 1: Joe Vs. The Volcano*

DecisionWise Consultants Spencer Taylor and Kenna Bryan examine the 1990 film ‚ÄúJoe Vs. The Volcano‚Äù starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.

In the opening scenes, we watch as employees file in to start their day in a terrible work environment. It‚Äôs dark, dirty, depressing, and management is openly hostile toward their employees. We find this movie filled with examples of what not to do when you consider the employees experience, and we give some recommendations on how to do things better.

9/24/20, 9:59 AM - +974 6673 5717: I have an HR educational question,

If the priority is applicable HR knowledge and practice in the gulf area;

Should someone persue SPHR or CIPD?

Appreciate your feedback in advance
9/24/20, 10:08 AM - +971 55 289 9973: Neither really covers gcc labour laws but i would suggest cipd as being the more recognised and globally valued qualification.
9/24/20, 10:08 AM - +974 5531 6150: THeres the Australian HR Institute ( AHRI ) Option as well which is cheaper than CIPD. It is also equivalant to CIPD as per their mutual recognition agreement.
9/24/20, 10:09 AM - +971 55 289 9973: Good to know!
9/24/20, 10:09 AM - +971 55 289 9973: And a great suggestion as cipd is expensive!
9/24/20, 10:10 AM - +974 6673 5717: Any recomended site to visit? Is it home study and online testing?
9/24/20, 10:13 AM - +974 5531 6150: yup CIPD's assessment, equivalation and then membership costs are really expensive
9/24/20, 10:13 AM - +974 5531 6150: ahri.com.au
9/24/20, 10:13 AM - +974 5531 6150: you will find all information on their site relating to the various options available for membership. See which you qualify for.
9/24/20, 10:14 AM - +974 5531 6150: if you are experienced you send them your profile and credentials for different levels of experience they have different memberships
9/24/20, 10:14 AM - +974 6673 5717: üôèüèΩThanks
9/24/20, 10:15 AM - +974 5531 6150: this is the AHRI body membership only.
9/24/20, 10:16 AM - +974 5531 6150: then you futher can do a case study project assessment on the basis of which they will assess and equate you to the certified members levels.  there is an annual requirement of CPD and online seminars , mentorship you then do to keep your membership valid.
9/24/20, 10:16 AM - +974 5531 6150: study it in detail on the website
9/24/20, 10:17 AM - +974 5531 6150: they used to send AHRI monthly magazines as well but now due to COVID they only do that online.
9/24/20, 10:21 AM - +974 5531 6150: if i remeber correctly the initial cost of membership and first year annual fee was 3000 QR and then the annual membership was 700 QR.
9/24/20, 10:21 AM - +974 5531 6150: Project Submission fee was 1800QR
9/24/20, 11:00 AM - +974 5046 8599: CIPD cost is cheaper compared to what we pay in QATAR. Completing evaluation assesssment is a difficult thing and there is no guarantee they would award you certification.
9/24/20, 11:01 AM - +974 5046 8599: I completed my CIPD level 7 advanced in July 2020 and i enrolled directly from UK.

I‚Äôm Arriz. An HR Professional and jobseeker in the UAE. Nice to meet you all ‚ò∫Ô∏è

In case there are issues when it comes to resumes/CVs being uploaded in the whatsapp group - I‚Äôve created a GoogleDrive folder so you can upload your CVs

Everyone will have access to it - Recruiters/ Employers and Jobseekers in this group. It may limit the uploading and re-uploading of CVs through whatsapp which causes flooding of messages. New joiners can be referred to the GoogleDrive folder to either upload their CVs, or review CVs of potential HR employees.

This can help us simply post more vacancies over other things in the chat.

What do you guys think?

What are your thoughts on this
10/1/20, 8:37 AM - +974 5531 6150: This statement needs to be backed by analytical data to be published as a fact. Example we all traditionally were told that putting your picture on your resume increases your chances of the CV being reviewed / chances of getting hired etc.  Seems logical as well. But in their summer 2018 monthly HR Magazine - AHRI published their market recruitment survey; which showed them that statistically  actually the opposite holds true.  Now again with AHRI was the sample size taken -- only for a local / regional market or a  multi regional market?  This is another issue which needs to be looked into.

Reminding you all to (if newjoiners, sharing with you all to) continue/start uploading your resumes to this GoogleDrive Folder:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-t_K9ou_J3aAjk9mo4A3y46GPuDEw1yG?usp=sharing

Label it in this format: Country - Name (Ex. UAE - Arriz Panopio)

This would allow the group‚Äôs recruiters to easily view jobseekers‚Äô profiles per country.

It will also minimize or totally eliminate the flooding and reuploading of resumes in our whatsapp group.

This can help us simply post more vacancies over other things in the chat. You can also see different resume templates as guides

I‚Äôll be sending this reminder every now and then for the benefit of our newjoiners and those who have yet to upload/view CVs.

Happy uploading!ü§ó

I‚Äôm reaching out to you all as I am currently searching for an opportunity in Human Resource vertical. With a strong background in HR and Administration, my experience of 10 years ranges from a recruitment-specific profile to a generalist profile where I was handling the entire gamut of HR.¬†

Currently, I am based out of Qatar and am working in a different profile for the past 1 year but I am keen to get back to working in an HR profile as that's where my strength and experience lie.¬†

The purpose of reaching out to you is to see if you are aware of or have come across any suitable positions/opportunities that may work for me.¬†

I can share my resume for you to get a better understanding of my profile and what I can bring to the table.¬†Looking forward to hearing from you.¬†

Thank you,

Reminding you all to (if newjoiners, sharing with you all to) continue/start uploading your resumes to this GoogleDrive Folder:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-t_K9ou_J3aAjk9mo4A3y46GPuDEw1yG?usp=sharing

Label it in this format: Country - Name (Ex. UAE - Arriz Panopio)

It will also minimize or totally eliminate the flooding and reuploading of resumes in our whatsapp group.

This can help us simply post more vacancies over other things in the chat. You can also see different resume templates as guides

I‚Äôll be sending this reminder every now and then for the benefit of our newjoiners and those who have yet to upload/view CVs.

Happy uploading!

11/8/20, 10:33 AM - +971 50 764 9928: Good afternoon, fellow HR Professionals and Jobseekers!

Reminding you all to (if newjoiners, sharing with you all to) continue/start uploading your resumes to this GoogleDrive Folder:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-t_K9ou_J3aAjk9mo4A3y46GPuDEw1yG?usp=sharing

Label it in this format: Country - Name (Ex. UAE - Arriz Panopio)

This would allow the group‚Äôs recruiters to easily view jobseekers‚Äô profiles per country.

It will also minimize or totally eliminate the flooding and reuploading of resumes in our whatsapp group.

This can help us simply post more vacancies over other things in the chat. You can also see different resume templates as guides

I‚Äôll be sending this reminder every now and then for the benefit of our newjoiners and those who have yet to upload/view CVs.

Happy uploading!

Please DO NOT. I repeat. DO NOT allow recruiters or hiring managers treat you this way.

And hopefully, once you become employed as HRs/Recruiters or even be Hiring Managers, I hope you‚Äôd treat candidates better than this as we all have been candidates for even once in our lives.

Belittling and pressuring candidates like this is not the way to go.

11/23/20, 9:09 AM - +971 50 764 9928: True that there are always two sides of a coin, and it would really depend on a person‚Äôs perception whether to accept or not - whatever the intention is.

11/23/20, 10:05 AM - +971 52 637 3988: Is the vacancies or recruitment in Dubai very less..I have been applying for past 5mnths and very rarely I approached a good available position in Dubai..
11/23/20, 10:11 AM - +971 50 764 9928: I see. So it would really depend on the professionals we approach, and I guess another factor would also be how we approach the ones we connect with or the ones who send us invitations to connect
11/23/20, 10:12 AM - +971 50 764 9928: The UAE market has been tough in general - even before the pandemic. Although the pandemic has heightened it, I think the market is slowly recovering and more opportunities may come our way.

A factor to consider though is that since UAE and the rest of the world are on the journey to recovery, salaries and opportunities might be a mismatch from expectations and experiences of the labor force. It may not be commensurate at the moment as we‚Äôre all trying to get back up. 

We‚Äôre all in hopes of seeing a better opportunity though but nothing is guaranteed
11/23/20, 10:12 AM - +971 50 764 9928: Keep trying!

Reminding you all to (if newjoiners, sharing with you all to) continue/start uploading your resumes to this GoogleDrive Folder:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-t_K9ou_J3aAjk9mo4A3y46GPuDEw1yG?usp=sharing

Label it in this format: Country - Name (Ex. UAE - Arriz Panopio)

This would allow the group‚Äôs recruiters to easily view jobseekers‚Äô profiles per country.

It will also minimize or totally eliminate the flooding and reuploading of resumes in our whatsapp group.

This can help us simply post more vacancies over other things in the chat. You can also see different resume templates as guides

I‚Äôll be sending this reminder every now and then for the benefit of our newjoiners and those who have yet to upload/view CVs.

Happy uploading!

I have deleted the files that were labelled incorrectly. If you need help in uploading and labelling, please reach out to me.

Please reupload with the correct label (and only upload CVs - I have seen cerificates and other irrelevant documents). This is to help employers and recruiters view CVs per country easily.

Cheers!

11/28/20, 8:46 AM - +971 50 764 9928: Hello

I have tried my best in recovering our resumes and CVs, and have contacted Google Support for additional assistance however, there really is no way for me to retrieve files if I wasn't the one who created them or removed them in the first place. 

With this, I would like to apologize for the inconvenience it has caused the group. 

We will have to re-upload your files once more - and I will work with you on this. This time around, instead of granting everyone access to edit, I will be the one to upload your CVs for you and grant you viewer access. I will now be the only person to upload and remove files. You may view them. If you want a copy of the files to edit them (jobseekers) or download them (recruiters/hiring managers), you may ask for my permission.

Please email your updated CV to zirrapples@gmail.com
File Name: Country - Name (ex. UAE - Arriz Panopio)
The country is for your target country in the GCC region

I will not upload incorrect files (ONLY RESUMES/CVs ARE ACCEPTED) or mislabeled files.
Thank you
11/28/20, 8:49 AM - +971 55 289 9973: Is it worth using a different option like drop box? Where maybe there is a little more control? I think you can set it up to allow additions but not deletions.

Members of the group will have access to HR CVs in the GCC region through a shared GoogleDrive folder. For those interested, please email me.

FOR JOBSEEKERS:
Please email your updated CV to zirrapples@gmail.com
File Name: Country - Name (ex. UAE - Arriz Panopio)
The country is for your target country in the GCC region. Pick a country of priority if you are open to different countries in the GCC region.

I will be the one to upload your CVs and grant you viewer access. I will be the only person to upload and remove files. If you want a copy of the files to edit them (jobseekers) or download them (recruiters/hiring managers), you may ask for my permission.

I will not upload incorrect files (ONLY RESUMES/CVs ARE ACCEPTED) or mislabeled files.

This would allow the group‚Äôs recruiters to easily view job seekers‚Äô profiles per country.

It will also minimize or totally eliminate the flooding and reuploading of resumes in our WhatsApp group.

This can help us simply post more vacancies over other things in the chat. You can also see different resume templates as guides

I‚Äôll be sending this reminder every now and then for the benefit of our new joiners and those who have yet to upload/view CVs.

Cheers!
12/9/20, 6:20 PM - +971 50 764 9928: I ask you to please read my whole message and follow instructions. We're all adults here. This will save all of us time in editing/revising mislabelled CVs or emailing me incorrect files.

12/12/20, 4:04 PM - +971 50 764 9928: Hello, guys!

As it is a weekend, I‚Äôm gonna be sharing a non-HR related post (@971552899973 @97466283548 please pardon me this once haha!) but an encouraging message to our many jobseekers in the group!

I, too, am going through a tough time in landing a role but I want you to know that this community made jobhunting more tolerable for me. I‚Äôve learned a lot based on the discussions every now and then, saw many opportunities to apply to, and met wonderful people that was only possible because of this group. And I think, that‚Äôs one of the best things that ever happened to me this year. 

2020 has been tough. But I believe it‚Äôs only because it was made to toughen us up for 2021 and the coming years. I‚Äôm glad I have you all here with me. We conquered this year together. Just a few more weeks before 2021.

Before the year ends, it is up to you to spend the remaining weeks to either rest and take time for yourselves or spend it with loved ones. Give yourself a pat on the back. As employees take breaks, even jobhunters like us shall, too.

And the other option is to, of course, keep on going! The holidays won‚Äôt be an excuse to stop you from landing a role! So, go for it!

Have a great evening ü§óü§óü§ó

12/16/20, 7:54 AM - +971 50 764 9928: Hi everyone!

Members of the group will have access to HR CVs in the GCC region through a shared GoogleDrive folder. For those interested, please email me.

FOR JOBSEEKERS:
Please email your updated CV to zirrapples@gmail.com
File Name: Country - Name (ex. UAE - Arriz Panopio)
The country is for your target country in the GCC region. Pick a country of priority if you are open to different countries in the GCC region.

I will be the one to upload your CVs and grant you viewer access. I will be the only person to upload and remove files. If you want a copy of the files to edit them (jobseekers) or download them (recruiters/hiring managers), you may ask for my permission.

I will not upload incorrect files (ONLY RESUMES/CVs ARE ACCEPTED) or mislabeled files.

This would allow the group‚Äôs recruiters to easily view job seekers‚Äô profiles per country.

It will also minimize or totally eliminate the flooding and reuploading of resumes in our WhatsApp group.

This can help us simply post more vacancies over other things in the chat. You can also see different resume templates as guides

I‚Äôll be sending this reminder every now and then for the benefit of our new joiners and those who have yet to upload/view CVs.

Cheers!
12/16/20, 8:06 AM - +971 50 764 9928: Thank you to those who have emailed me. For those who haven't, no worries! I will be waiting until the end of the week to upload your profiles. I send these reminders every now and then anyway, so please wait for the next batch if you aren't able to send this time around.
12/16/20, 8:08 AM - +971 50 764 9928: Oh and if it's not too much, please check out my poll on LinkedIn (First ever poll made! I'm so excited about it!).

I will be the one to upload your CVs and grant you viewer access. I will be the only person to upload and remove files. If you want a copy of the files to edit them (jobseekers) or download them (recruiters/hiring managers), you may ask for my permission.

I will not upload incorrect files (ONLY RESUMES/CVs ARE ACCEPTED) or mislabeled files.

This would allow the group‚Äôs recruiters to easily view job seekers‚Äô profiles per country.

It will also minimize or totally eliminate the flooding and reuploading of resumes in our WhatsApp group.

This can help us simply post more vacancies over other things in the chat. You can also see different resume templates as guides

I‚Äôll be sending this reminder every now and then for the benefit of our new joiners and those who have yet to upload/view CVs.

Cheers!

12/22/20, 8:41 PM - +971 50 764 9928: Hi Everyone,

I've done some uploading of your CVs to the Google Drive Folder.

For those who have followed my instructions in sending me an email and labeling their CVs in the requested format (Country - Full Name), THANK YOU!
It saves me so much time in uploading it to our shared folder

For those who need more clarification, please let me know. I have delayed responses due to the volume of messages I receive in a day, but rest assured that I will get back to you. If I haven't, please wait for it (or check your Spam Folder)

For our newbies in the group, I'll send instructions in a bit. Please follow them. It saves us all time if you send me the correctly labeled/named CV and file. I will not be accepting incorrectly labeled files and non-CV documents.

I'd have loved to rename all the mislabeled files myself but there are a lot of people sending me CVs, and it would take so much time to rename all. Please understand and let's help each other out
12/22/20, 8:45 PM - +971 50 764 9928: Members of the group will have access to HR CVs in the GCC region through a shared GoogleDrive folder. For those interested, please email me.

FOR RECRUITERS:
Let me know if you need access to the folder. I have created subfolders for each country for easy viewing.

FOR JOBSEEKERS:
Please email your updated CV to zirrapples@gmail.com
File Name: Country - Name (ex. UAE - Arriz Panopio)
The country is for your target country in the GCC region. Pick a country of priority if you are open to different countries in the GCC region.

1/6/21, 7:24 PM - +971 50 764 9928: Hi, everyone! Sorry haven‚Äôt been in touch lately. Happy new year üå∏üå∏ü§óü§ó

May I ask if internship opportunities require work permits in the UAE? I‚Äôve been considered for an intern role as I am new in the UAE. Their head office is in DMCC, and the other office is in Al Quoz. I can work in either location. They want me to start the soonest time but I do not have a work permit yet so I feel worried. I am on my parent‚Äôs visa if this has any bearing on the matter.

Please educate me.
1/6/21, 7:30 PM - +971 55 289 9973: Yes you do need a residency visa either under family sponsorship or as a student
1/6/21, 7:30 PM - +971 55 289 9973: Or a full time employment visa

1/22/21, 4:04 PM - +971 55 289 9973: What specific skills do you need?
1/22/21, 4:04 PM - +971 55 289 9973: HR is mostly transferrable between industries no?
1/22/21, 4:17 PM - +974 7004 2007: Yes HR skills are transferable however there are some nuances of every industry which we will need to learn and adapt
1/22/21, 4:29 PM - +91 95040 26606: Definitely yes, But the very basing attribute for being successful as an HR is to understand the business of that particular Industry and setup, if one doesn't he/she definitely going to fail.
1/22/21, 4:39 PM - +974 5570 8338: Totally agree! the core hr function is same
There's a misconception that being an hrm from different industry would not succeed! I believe it's just a matter of little time to understand the business, however a good hr is able to adapt to every industry
1/22/21, 4:51 PM - +974 7004 2007: Industries somehow have a mindset of recruiting HR from the same industry thus missing out on the freshness and divergent perspective which someone who is not from the same industry may infuse into the business and help in bringing a change
1/22/21, 5:11 PM - +971 55 289 9973: This is very true and most frustrating!
1/22/21, 5:12 PM - +971 55 289 9973: I agree, it is possible to learn a new industry

1/30/21, 2:34 PM - +971 55 289 9973: Hi folks,

I‚Äôm looking to recruit the following roles:

Jr HRBP 
TR/C&B Partner
TA Partner 

All the roles will report into the HR Head for a family owned group of companies with interests in automotive, real estate, O&G and jewelry and have group wide remit. 

Roles are based in AD and will pay between 15-18k plus benefits. Groups going through a change right now so you gotta be headstrong and willing to get down and dirty.

Pls read out to me directly if you know or someone you know might be interested. Thank you.
1/30/21, 2:34 PM - +971 55 289 9973: I must mention that due to the ongoing covid restrictions, the roles are only open to candidates currently in the UAE.
1/30/21, 2:39 PM - +971 55 289 9973: These are not my vacancies but from a member in another of our HR Jobs groups
1/30/21, 2:45 PM - +971 55 289 9973: They can reach out on my number pls. It‚Äôs: 0501390067
1/30/21, 2:47 PM - +971 55 289 9973: Please read the details of the post and apply only if you meet the criteria. I have been approached by individuals who are not in UAE stating they want to apply. I am 99% sure that if you are not in the UAE your application will be rejected so why bother to apply? Why waste your time and that of your HR colleague‚Äôs by not following the instruction. If it wasnt a clear requirement I fully encourage you but this is not the case. Please respect that.
1/30/21, 3:03 PM - +971 55 289 9973: Thank you, Sarah. That‚Äôs right, I‚Äôm afraid the roles are only open to ppl in the UAE atm. 

I‚Äôd also like to mention that the HR Head has himself recently joined the group and is looking to build his team so the opportunities to learn and grow will be immense which will also mean that you‚Äôll be pushed to deliver under tight deadlines as the HR Head looks to earn the trust of the business. 

You won‚Äôt fit in if you‚Äôre used to workin at a leisurely pace. E.g the TR Partner will be solely responsible for job evals/grading and coming up with job bands and comp structure so you‚Äôll be working towards clear deliverables and will have your feet held to the fire. 

Pls keep this in mind while applying.

2/25/21, 6:52 PM - +971 55 289 9973: MISSING GIRL IN UMM SUQUEIM

Hoping this amazing community can help a distraught family find their 16 year old daughter.
Harini Karani went for her early morning walk as usual this morning, between 6.30am - 7am and hasn't been seen since.

Her family are appealing to anyone in the area between Al Manara Street and Al Thanya Street, between Al Wasl Road and Beach Road who was up and about this morning.

Harini is 5ft 5, long dark hair, wears glasses. Would have been wearing Black T-shirt, Black leggings and Birkenstock‚Äôs (which meant she had only planned to go out for a short walk).

She was without her phone.

Dubai authorities are already involved, so we're all hoping she is found safe and sound quickly!

Please DM me if you have any information and I shall share with her family.

*I do hope admin don't mind me posting

6/17/21, 4:28 PM - +971 52 860 4673: COVID-19 brought unprecedented human and humanitarian challenges and now that restrictions are being lifted, a New Normal is descending on all organizations. Companies that acted swiftly to safeguard employees are recognizing that the New Normal includes migrating to new ways of working never envisioned before. The pandemic has forced organization to reimagine work and executive teams must re-examine their role in creating safe and productive environments that focus on the well-being of employees.

In creative and bold ways and across all industries, leaders are using the lessons from this large-scale work-from-home experiment to reimagine how work is done, what role offices should play, and how managers can provide stability and keep employees moving forward to the company vision of productivity and viability in the marketplace. Savvy leaders are acknowledging the reality of the uncertainty and unfamiliarity we have endured and are now crafting cultures of resilience, determination, and perseverance based on solid principles of management.

This webinar guides the process of emerging from the Pandemic more flexible, stronger, and focused. With concepts coming from her book, ‚ÄúHow to Earn the Gift of Discretionary Effort,‚Äù in this webinar, Karla Brandau teaches you how to:
‚Ä¢ Focus on the well-being of each employee.
‚Ä¢ Encourage employees to improve self-care and life-style.
‚Ä¢ Ensure each employee is extended psychological safety.
‚Ä¢ Inspire social acceptance and inclusion at all levels of the organization.
‚Ä¢ Rationally align employees with company goals and objectives.
‚Ä¢ Build a resilient culture built on the determination to succeed.
‚Ä¢ Handle employees who are ‚Äúbetwixt and between‚Äù the office and work from home.
‚Ä¢ Create a culture of gratitude.
